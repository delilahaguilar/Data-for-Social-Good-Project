Who Helped Me: Peers, Ai, Mr.Aiello

What I asked:
Peers: During the project my partner and I had struggled to create a for loop and whenever it ran there was constant error.So I asked
one of my peers in a different class to help
explain the process of it. 

Ai: Once we finished coding there were errors that I wasn't sure how to fix so I asked Copy and pasted the errors that was shown and 
asked how I can fix it so it could run. 

Mr.Aiello: What dataset would work best, how to insert it

What response I recieved: 
Peers: She explained that the error we had in our for loop was that we were using the wrong variable and small mistakes like semicolon
caused it not to run.

Ai: ChatGpt explained that there was small errors such as spaces or typos. One of the main issues was that we were using String array
when instead we were supposed to use IntArray because we're storing numbers (minutestreamed). Another main issue was that the code kept
returning variable i not found. This was because our for loop ended early because we accidentally put a semicolon at the end of it 
Example: Orginal code : for (int i = 0; i < minutestreamed.length; i++); { fixed: for (int i = 0; i < minutestreamed.length; i++) {
When i is outside the loop; it doesn't exist

Mr.Aiello: We asked Mr.Aiello what dataset would work best based off of our topic, and then he showed us how to insert it into 
Google Sheets. Then we determined what would be most useful and insert it into code.org. Lastly we also used the starter code 
provided in the project google slides.
