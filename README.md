# Data-for-Social-Good-Project
Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need.
Project Requirements
Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program:
Write a class – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors.
Create 1D arrays – Create 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about.
Write a method – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs.
Implement a toString() method – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset).
Document your code – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.
Optional Features
Incorporate user interaction – Use methods in the Scanner class to obtain user input to interact with your data analysis program.
Use inheritance and polymorphism – Create classes to represent the types of data with overridden methods and use a 1D array of a superclass type to store the objects.

Step 1: Choose your user
Create your own user story for your program. For your user or business, list the questions they might have or the information they need.
Create Your Own
As a music enthusiast I want to analyze the most listened to genre so that I can find what genre is the most popular.


Possible Extensions: Number of Songs, Genres, Minutes streamed








Possible Questions: How many genre are there? Most listened to artist? Top 3 genres?

Step 2: Getting Data
Finding datasets online can be daunting, here are some websites data contain a bunch of datasets you can search start:

Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/
Data.gov, https://catalog.data.gov/dataset
World Bank, https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx
UNICEF, https://data.unicef.org/resources/resource-type/datasets/
United States Census Bureau, https://data.census.gov/cedsci/
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, https://www.bls.gov/data/
NASA, https://data.nasa.gov/browse

There are many other websites with datasets in addition to these that you can explore and use!


You must find a data set that can be downloaded as a .csv or .xlsx file (most common file format for spreadsheets). If you can download as .csv or .xlsx file, you will need to manually copy over the column of data to a Google Sheet before creating a .txt file.

Use Google Sheets to format/clean your data before making .txt files.
Open the .csv or .xlsx file in Google Sheets to format and clean your data.
Use some of Google Sheets function to help clean the data
Ctrl + Shift + V pastes data WITHOUT FORMATING (this will paste the raw data not with any formulas and relative values)

See Unit 3 - Instructions & Resources for more instructions or ask Aiello

Step 3: Create UML diagrams for your classes
Software engineers often use UML diagrams (Unified Modeling Language) to represent the classes in a program.
A UML diagram for a class is a rectangle that is divided into three sections: the first section for the name of the class, the second section for its instance variables, and the third section for its methods.
Create a UML diagram for your class that will represent your user and any additional classes you might need.

Click the image to the left and choose “Edit” to make your UML on this document, or Click Here to go to a separate Google Drawing.
Save this image so you can include it on your README.md when you commit your project to GitHub!
